Orchestra.io Example Facebook Application
-----------------------------------------

This piece of code is a very simple facebook application code. 

If you would like to have your own facebook application hosted on the Orchestra.io platform, you can
easily **fork** this repository, put your very own **app id** and **secret key** in the index.php, deploy
this application on Orchestra and then [get started with facebook](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/) where
you will have an endpoint to use and, more importantly, a **secure** endpoint as well. 

Yes that's right, Orchestra.io provides every user with HTTPS on their **app-name.orchestra.io** URLs! So if you deploy an
application you named "facebook-application", you instantly get access to **https://facebook-application.orchestra.io** and
**http://facebook-application.orchestra.io**.

Recap
=====

  1. Fork this repository and configure your own **app id** and **secret key** in the ***index.php*** file
